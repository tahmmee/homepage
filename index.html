I was <a href="photos.hostwithnoname.com">looking</a> at all the life
There was <a href="tech.hostwithnoname.com">sand</a> and hills and rings
And the air was full of <a href="music.hostwithnoname.com">sound</a>

In the desert you can <a href="vault.hostwithnoname.com">remember</a> your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

I was looking at a river bed
And the <a href="blog.hostwithnoname.com">story</a> it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
